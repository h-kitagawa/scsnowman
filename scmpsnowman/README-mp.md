# scmpsnowman

This is a port of the scsnowman package to use mplib library
(the MetaPost library which is integrated into LuaTeX), instead of TikZ.

## Requirements

This package does NOT require "tikz" package.
On the other hand, this package requires following packages:
 - luamplib
 - color
 - etoolbox
 - keyval

The xcolor package is not required, but highly recommended.
